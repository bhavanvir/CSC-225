# CSC 225: Algorithms and Data Structures

## Course Overview
Steps applied when solving a problem using the computer include

    • clearly defining the problem,
    • choosing an algorithm and data structures,
    • developing pseudocode,
    • implementing the algorithm,
    • ensuring correctness using code verification and testing, and
    • evaluating the effectiveness of the solution.

The goal of this class is to illustrate this process and develop these skills starting with some traditional problems, algorithms and data structures. The performance of a program on small inputs (typical in introductory computer science courses) gives no indication of how an algorithm will perform on the large inputs often found in real applications. Paper and pencil techniques are presented for analysing algorithms for time and space requirements on large inputs without requiring the effort of implementation. Algorithms are compared with respect to their worst, average, and best case performances.

The techniques learned in the course are applied to well-studied classical problems including searching, sorting, and some graph theory applications. The study of abstract data types is continued from CSC 115 but the focus changes from that of understanding the data types to being able to make knowledgeable choices as to the best data structures for a particular application.

## Course Objectives And Learning Outcomes

Students will learn the skills required for algorithm development for the algorithms and data structures studied in the class, and should be able to apply these same steps to new situations which are similar.
The skills developed include improved competence in all steps for the problem solving process:

    • precision in problem specification,
    • understanding the algorithms and data structures presented in class,
    • showing what happens on examples of these,
    • setting up and solving recurrences for time and space complexities,
    • writing recursive algorithms,
    • proving program correctness, and that recurrence solutions are correct by induction,
    • faithful (preserving time and space complexity) translation of pseudocode to working code, and
    • comparisons of alternate solutions to a problem based on time and/or space requirements.
