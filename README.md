# CSC 225: Algorithms and Data Structures

## Course Overview
Steps applied when solving a problem using the computer include

    • clearly defining the problem,
    • choosing an algorithm and data structures,
    • developing pseudocode,
    • implementing the algorithm,
    • ensuring correctness using code verification and testing, and
    • evaluating the effectiveness of the solution.

The goal of this class is to illustrate this process and develop these skills starting with some traditional problems, algorithms and data structures. The performance of a program on small inputs (typical in introductory computer science courses) gives no indication of how an algorithm will perform on the large inputs often found in real applications. Paper and pencil techniques are presented for analysing algorithms for time and space requirements on large inputs without requiring the effort of implementation. Algorithms are compared with respect to their worst, average, and best case performances.

The techniques learned in the course are applied to well-studied classical problems including searching, sorting, and some graph theory applications. The study of abstract data types is continued from CSC 115 but the focus changes from that of understanding the data types to being able to make knowledgeable choices as to the best data structures for a particular application.
